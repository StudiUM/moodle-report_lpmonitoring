  "body": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this plugin is to facilitate the work of learning plan managers. \r\nIt provides an overview of user learning plan, without leaving the page to get information related to this learning plan(such as rating in courses,user evidence,). It also offers statistics by learning plans and competencies.\r\nFor learning plan templates with a very large number of learning plans (generated from cohorts), this plugin is the best solution, with its advanced filter, it allows you to filter the learning plans by several criteria.\r\n\r\n# Plugin configuration\r\n## Role and permissions\r\nThis plugin can be used in system or category context.\r\nThe user using this plugin in the category must have these permissions:\r\n\r\n* moodle/competency:competencyview\r\n* moodle/competency:coursecompetencyview\r\n* moodle/competency:usercompetencyview\r\n* moodle/competency:usercompetencymanage\r\n* moodle/competency:competencygrade\r\n* moodle/competency:planview\r\n* moodle/competency:planmanage\r\n* moodle/competency:templateview\r\n\r\nNote that planview is always set in user context level. Thus, we must assign a user to a cohort using `Site administration/Users/Permissions/Assign user roles to cohort` so he will have the \"moodle/competency:planview\" of every member of that specific cohort (must wait for the next cron execution to take effect).\r\n\r\n## color configuration\r\n\r\nTo fully benefit from the reports, a color must be associated to each value of the scale.\r\nTo set the scale values colors, you must have \"moodle/competency:competencymanage\" permission.\r\nHere are the steps :\r\n* Go on \"Home / ► Site administration / ► Competencies / ► Competencies scale colors\"\r\n* Choose a framework competency\r\n* Choose a scale from framework competency\r\n* set the colors values using the ColorPicker\r\n* save the changes\r\n\r\n![Colors configuration](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoring_colors.PNG)\r\n\r\nThat's it, now the colors are set and ready to be used in the reports pages.\r\n\r\n# Monitoring of learning plans page\r\n\r\nIn a category context or system context go on `Reports / ► Monitoring of learning plans`\r\n\r\n## Filter\r\n\r\nFiltering helps us find a learning plan for a user, you can filter the learning plans Here are the steps:\r\n\r\n### By learning plan template\r\n\r\nFrom a learning plan template, we can filter learning plans.\r\n* Select a template\r\n* and from \"Student using this template\", select a user\r\n* click on \"Apply\"\r\n\r\nYou will see the learning plan of the student selected, and you can navigate between learning plan from the template.\r\nIf there is no student selected, the first student from the template will be displayed.\r\n\r\n![Filter by template](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoring_filterbytemplatesimple.PNG)\r\n\r\nBy clicking on \"show more...\", you can have more options to filter learning plans by scales values.\r\n\r\n![Filter scales values](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringscalesvaluesfilter.PNG)\r\n\r\nThere are two options for using scales values filter\r\n\r\nscreenshot report_lpmonitoringscalesvaluesfilteroptionsbycourse\r\n* filtering learning plan by scales values rated in the course competency\r\n* filtering learning plan by scales values rated in the plan\r\n\r\nWhen filtering by scales values, the number of rating in the student list will be displayed:\r\n\r\n![Filter rating number](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringscalesvaluesfilternbrating.png)\r\n\r\n### By user\r\nWe can choose a particular student by typing his name in the user picker field in order to retrieve his learning plans \r\n\r\n![Filter by student](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoring_filterbystudent.png)\r\n\r\n## Learning plan detail\r\n\r\nThe details of the learning plan is divided into three blocks:\r\n\r\n![Filter by student](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringlearningplanglobal.PNG)\r\n\r\n### 1.User navigation\r\nThis block contain the following informations:\r\n\r\n* The learning plan name: link to the learning plan page\r\n* The user full name and a profile picture: link to the user profile page\r\n* The navigation between users that belong to the template selected.\r\n\r\n![User navigation](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringusernavigation.PNG)\r\n\r\n### 2.Learning plan competencies informations\r\nThis block displays the following informations:\r\n\r\n* proficient competencies number on the total number of competencies\r\n* not proficient competencies number\r\n* not rated competencies number\r\n\r\n![Learning plan competencies informations](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringplancompetenciesinfo.PNG)\r\n\r\n### 3.List competencies details\r\n\r\nThis part has three blocks\r\n\r\n![List competencies details](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringplancompetencydetail.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Total number of rating**\r\n\r\nIt display the number of courses linked to the competency and wherein the user is enrolled, Clicking on the number will trigger a popup containing the list of course linked to the competency and if the course was rated or not.\r\n\r\n![Popup total number courses](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringplancompetencynbtotalcourse.PNG)\r\n\r\nAlso, this block display the number of evidence of prior learning. You can have more details on the list of evidence by clicking on this number\r\n\r\n![evidence of prior learning](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringplancompetencypopupevidence.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Rating**\r\n\r\nThis block display the number of rated courses by scale value. Clicking on this number triggers a popup that displays the course name, comments left by the teacher and the final course grade.\r\n\r\n![Rated courses by scale value](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringlearningcourselistbyscalevalue.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Final rating**\r\n\r\nThis block give us details about the final rating (rating in learning plan) :\r\n* if the competency is proficient, not proficient or not rated\r\n* the value of rating (if rated)\r\n* button to rate the competency if user has permission to rate\r\n\r\n![Competency final rating](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringlearningcompetencyfinalrating.PNG)\r\n\r\n# Statistics for learning plans\r\n\r\nThis page provides statistics for learning plans.\r\nIt groups statistics by competency for a given template. For each competency we display the total users in template and number of users by scale value.\r\nTo get this page, go on `Reports / ► Statistics for learning plans`\r\n\r\n![Stats page](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringstatistics.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Total users**\r\n\r\nClicking on the \"Total users\" number triggers a popup with the list of all the user related to this competency. It shows if each user has been rated.\r\n\r\n![Stats nb users](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringstatstotalusers.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Number of users by scale value**\r\n\r\nIt display the number of users rated with a given scale value in the competency.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Stats user by scalevalue](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringstatsusersbyscalevalue.PNG)\r\n\r\n# Monitoring of learning plans for students\r\n\r\nThis page allows s student to keep track of his learning plans with all the details mentioned above. To get this page go to the user profile page and click on Monitoring of learning plans in the reports block.\r\n\r\n![Profile user](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringprofilepage.PNG)\r\n\r\nTo see the report of the learning plan, the student should select a learning plan and click on \"Apply\"\r\n\r\n![Student lpmonitoring](https://wiki.umontreal.ca/download/attachments/124980567/report_lpmonitoringstudentdetail.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
