  "body": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this plugin is to facilitate the work of learning plan managers. \r\nIt provides an overview of user learning plan, without leaving the page to get information related to this learning plan(such as rating in courses,user evidence,). It also offers statistics by learning plans and competencies.\r\nFor learning plan templates with a very large number of learning plans (generated from cohorts), this plugin is the best solution, with its advanced filter, it allows you to filter the learning plans by several criteria.\r\n\r\n# Plugin configuration\r\n## Role and permissions\r\nThis plugin can be used in system context or a category context.\r\nThe user using this plugin in the category must have these permissions:\r\n\r\n* moodle/competency:competencyview\r\n* moodle/competency:coursecompetencyview\r\n* moodle/competency:usercompetencyview\r\n* moodle/competency:usercompetencymanage\r\n* moodle/competency:competencygrade\r\n* moodle/competency:planview\r\n* moodle/competency:planmanage\r\n* moodle/competency:templateview\r\n\r\nNote that planview is always set in user context level, so we have to use \r\n\"Home/Site administration/Users/Permissions/Assign user roles to cohort\"\r\nto make the role of user using the plugin to have the \"moodle/competency:planview\" of the user (waiting the next cron execution to take effect).\r\n\r\n## color configuration\r\n\r\nTo fully benefit from the reports, a color must be associated to each value of the scale.\r\nTo set the scale values colors, you must have \"moodle/competency:competencymanage\" permission.\r\nHere the steps to do this:\r\n* Go on \"Home / ► Site administration / ► Competencies / ► Competencies scale colors\"\r\n* Choose a framework competency\r\n* Choose a scale from framework competency\r\n* set the colors values using the ColorPicker\r\n* save the changes\r\n\r\n![Colors configuration](http://shorturl.ca/images/report_lpmonitoring_colors.PNG)\r\n\r\nThat's it, now the colors are configured and ready to be used in the reports pages.\r\n\r\n# Monitoring of learning plans page\r\n\r\nIn a category context or system context go on \"Reports / ► Monitoring of learning plans\"\r\n\r\n## Filter\r\n\r\nFilter helps us find a learning plan for a user, you can filter the learning plans on two levels:\r\n\r\n### By learning plan template\r\n\r\nWe can, from a learning plan template, filtering learning plans. To do this:\r\n* Select a template\r\n* and from \"Student using this template\", select a user\r\n* click on \"Apply\"\r\n\r\nYou will see the learning plan of the student selected, and you can navigate between learning plan from the template.\r\nIf there is no student selected, the first student from the template will be displayed.\r\n\r\n![Filter by template](http://shorturl.ca/images/report_lpmonitoring_filterbytemplatesimple.PNG)\r\n\r\nBy clicking on \"show more...\", you can have more options to filter learning plans by scales values.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Filter scales values](http://shorturl.ca/images/report_lpmonitoringscalesvaluesfilter.PNG)\r\n\r\nThere are two options for using scales values filter\r\n\r\nscreenshot report_lpmonitoringscalesvaluesfilteroptionsbycourse\r\n* filtering learning plan by scales values rated in the course competency\r\n* filtering learning plan by scales values rated in the plan\r\n\r\nWhen filtering by scales values, the number of rating in the student list will be displayed:\r\n\r\n![Filter rating number](http://shorturl.ca/images/report_lpmonitoringscalesvaluesfilternbrating.png)\r\n\r\n### By user\r\nWe can choose a particular student by writing his name in the user picker field, and get his learning plans \r\n\r\n![Filter by student](http://shorturl.ca/images/report_lpmonitoring_filterbystudent.png)\r\n\r\n## Learning plan detail\r\n\r\nThe details of the learning plan is divided into three blocks:\r\n\r\n![Filter by student](http://shorturl.ca/images/report_lpmonitoringlearningplanglobal.PNG)\r\n\r\n### User navigation\r\nThis block contain the following informations:\r\n\r\n* The learning plan name: link to the learning plan page\r\n* The user full name and a profile picture: link to the user profile page\r\n* The navigation between users that belong to the template selected, on click it switch to the user selected\r\n\r\n![User navigation](http://shorturl.ca/images/report_lpmonitoringusernavigation.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonitoring of learning plans page for student\r\n\r\n\r\n",
